This week's assignment proved to be a little more difficult and ambitious than I expected. I chose to work with a gasoline price dataset
that had multiple values for the headers, which were Regular, Midgrade, Premium, and Diesel. At first I had difficulty getting the x axis to show since my dates needed reformating and I had to spend some time searching how to get the axis to show. Then I had diffculty having the line graph show in the svg, which I resolved by adding a unique class identifier to each individual line chart and having them "disapper" as the user would change the options in the dropdown menu. Then I had difficulty getting the area graph to format along with my data set since I had multiple lines of code for each line graph which was already relying on CSS code to have the line charts disappear and reappear when the dropdown menu was changed. The only easy part of this assignment for me was setting the scales. Having to set a class identifier for each gas category may have been the root of the issues I was having. On monday I checked on my peers code and most of them were concise and straightforward. I was however able to get multiple lines appear on the SVG but unfortunately that was not part of the assignment. Trying to get the transitions to work was also pretty difficult since having multiple classes of the line charts was causing a majority of the issues at hand.
